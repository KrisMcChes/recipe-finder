        "description": "What’s not to love about risotto? It’s luxurious, comforting, and never fails to satisfy. With a reputation for being labor intensive—ours couldn’t be easier! This version begins as classic as can be, with rich veggie stock and the addition of sweet-tart sun-dried tomatoes. It’s finished with zesty spice-roasted zucchini and grape tomatoes, two perfect contrasts to risotto’s creamy richness. For a finishing touch, everything receives a generous sprinkle of Parmesan.",
